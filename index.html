			<p>Manhole covers in the wellington reigon that are connected to the internet in some way.</p>

				<h3>Chorus</h3>
				<p>This is a smaller plastic Manhole which I located near someone's house. It looked to be feeding internet through a cable up into the house.</p>
			</div>
		</div>


		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/Manhole_3.jpg">

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Electricity</h3>
				<p>This Manhole cover clearly has something to do with electricity. Although this may not be in direct connection to internet cables or the physical forms of interent, internet is powered by electricity</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/Manhole_4.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Telecom</h3>
				<p>This Manhole cover is owned by Telecom. This leads me to believe that it is connected to the internet through its form of either wifi or cellphone internet. This manhole made me think that perhaps this contibutes to mobile data in someway or simply provides access to internet cables.</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Chorus Manhole 2</h3>
				<p>This is another chorus Manhole cover. I believe this one to be for a much larger purpose than the latter as it was not close to a certain house and was also much larger. Perhpas this one is similar to the Telecom one or is a connection to Chorus' internet cables.</p>

				<h3>Street Security</h3>
				<p>This security camera was connected to a traffic light. However, I don't believe it is used simply for traffic violations but also may be used to monitor criminal activity and other street activities. This camera would be using the internet to send information.</p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Private Security</h3>
				<p>This Camera was pointing at the backyard of someones home. This is clearly for home security and uses the internet to send information to (most likely) the owners smartphone so they can monitor their home whilst they are not there.</p>

				<h3>Road marking 3</h3>
				<p>From what I can see I think that this road marking is connected to the internet company chorus and may be a label to show were a new internet cable is going to be placed.</p>

				<h3>Phone Box</h3>
				<p>Not many people use phone boxes anymore and this one demonstrates that they generally act more so as wifi free zones. Yet, this is only for spark customers also demonstrating a different use of the internet for advertisment purposes</p>
